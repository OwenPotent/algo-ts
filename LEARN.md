# Learn how algorithms work and how to implement them in Typescript!

## Getting Started with Typescript

If you are new to Typescript, you can follow the steps below to get started:

1. Install Node.js on your system. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Install Typescript globally by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   npm install -g typescript
   ```
3. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.
4. Create a new file with a `.ts` extension and write some Typescript code!

Here are some useful resources to help you get started with Typescript:

- [Typescript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)
- [Typescript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play)
- [W3Schools Typescript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/)

## Wanna understand algorithms?

If you are new to algorithms and data structures, here are some resources to help you get started:

- [Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas H. Cormen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms)
- [Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)
- [Khan Academy Algorithms Course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms)
